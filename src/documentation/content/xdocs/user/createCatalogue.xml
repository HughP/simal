    <title>Create a catalogue</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>Simal is a system to enable you to build your own catalogue for your own purposes.
    This document describes how to do this by following through a single example.</p>
    
    <section>
      <title>A workshop attendee list</title>
      <p>We are going to build a catalogue that will assist in the organising and support
      of a workshop that will involve a subset of projects in the central Simal 
      catalogue. This catalogue will go through a number of iterations as the workshop
      goes through the planning stages and on into the implementation stages. In summary
      it will follow the following life cycle:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Planning: list of potential attendees</li>
        <li>Confirmations: list of projects will be reduced as confirmation of 
        attendance is recived</li>
        <li>Attendee list: the final list of attending proejcts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Planning</title>
      
      <p>In this first iteration we need to create a list of all projects that we
      intend to invite to the workshop. The first thing to do is create your Forrest
      content object for planning the workshop. From the command line run the following:</p>
      
      <source>
mkdir [PROJECT_HOME]
cd [PROJECT_HOME]
forrest seed-catalogue
      </source>
    </section>
  </body>
