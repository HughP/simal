    <title>Welcome to Simal Core</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>Simal Core is the main module for the Simal applications.
    It contains the RDF repository and a command line for interacting
    with that repository.</p>
    
    <p>Simal core comes complete with a command line interface.
    to run it use <code>simal.bat --help</code> or 
    <code>simal.sh --help</code>.</p>
    
    <warning>Simal Core is currently in alpha. It is subject to change
    in response to discussions on the <a href="ext:simal/devList">Simal developer list</a>.
    Please join us and help us make Simal what it should be.</warning>
    
    <note>Our documentation is quite sparse at present. Please ask
    for help on our <a href="ext:simal/devList">mailing list</a> and
    we'll be sure to expand the documentation in response to your 
    questions. Unless you ask, we don;t know what people need to
    see.</note>
