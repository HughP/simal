<shortdesc>The overall aim of the project is to evaluate the application and potential of e-Portfolios to support students through their lifelong learning journey, particularly at key transfer points in that journey. The project will examine three of those transfer points; Context 1, moving from school/FE into University; Context 2, moving from University into the workplace (both in placement experience and first career positions); and Context 3, moving between Universities.</shortdesc>
