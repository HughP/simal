<shortdesc>The aim of the project is to promote the use of e-learning amongst staff and students by developing interoperability between, B-Net (the College Intranet system), SITS (MIS) and Skillnet (VLE). We also want to provide a cost effective solution that can be applied to all colleges, using open standards where possible for development.</shortdesc>
