<shortdesc>This project seeks to develop and implement the Kepler/Ptolemy scientific workflow system as an interface to the Cheshire 3 digital library framework. The aim is to enable researchers in both the humanities and scientific disciplines to use the Kepler/Cheshire software to conduct analyses and perform distributed processing in several different software and hardware environments; and to coordinate the export and import of data from one environment to another.</shortdesc>
