<shortdesc>This project will focus on evaluating five different types of public repositories in the UK  i.e., repositories that are intended for use by people outside a hosting institution. Individual mission concerns for the selected repositories will be assessed through an analysis of their user needs, including a comparative evaluation of each type to determine how individual findings can be used to inform the practice of the others.</shortdesc>
