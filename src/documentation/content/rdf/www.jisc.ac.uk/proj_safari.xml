<shortdesc>This project will investigate, develop and test a system which will apply Shibboleth middleware to three resources hosted at Essex. Using these Essex-based resources, SAFARI will then embed the resulting system seamlessly within the one-stop registration service. The three resources to be 'shibbolised' are: ESDS, the Census Registration Service and the CHCC Collection of Historical Censuses. In order to place the resource targets within the registration service, a system of target-to-target communication will be developed. This will create a transfer mechanism to identify registered users, and thus prevent users from having to register more than once. A complementary communication method is also required to identify those special conditions to which users have agreed. The final system will be evaluated via user and stakeholder consultation. The technology which is developed in the course of this project could be utilised by many other federated services, which may wish to apply Shibboleth to a model of dispersed services around a central hub.</shortdesc>
