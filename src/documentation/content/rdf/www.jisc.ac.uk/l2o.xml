<shortdesc>The aim of the project is to pilot a model of regional collaborative partnerships sharing and re-using electronic learning resources across institutions and across sectors. Each partner will provide existing learning resources to generate re-usable learning objects (RLOs). The RLOs will be used by the consortium partners on their own, in combination and in association with other learning resources.</shortdesc>
