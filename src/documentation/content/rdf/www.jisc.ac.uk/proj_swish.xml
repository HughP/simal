<shortdesc>The University of Exeter has been using Athens DA for authenticated access to electronic resources since 1994.  With the JISC investigating Shibboleth as a possible successor to Athens, the primary activity of the SWISh project will be to pilot an authentication/authorisation system for electronic resources based on Shibboleth.  A secondary activity will be to explore the use of Shibboleth within the institution, with possible integration with the University portal, the institutional VLE and the Library management system.</shortdesc>
