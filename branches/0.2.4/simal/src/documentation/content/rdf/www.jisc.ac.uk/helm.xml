<shortdesc>This project is being conducted by the team that developed Horus, an e-technology to help doctors-in-training learn in workplaces. HeLM is an implementation project, which aims to increase the range of Horus services available to undergraduate medical students across a wider range of hospitals and other clinical workplaces. It will strengthen Horus support to in-depth reflective learning, extend the support to teachers as well as students, scope the application of Horus services to other higher education courses, and draw together learning and assessment within a single virtual learning environment.</shortdesc>
