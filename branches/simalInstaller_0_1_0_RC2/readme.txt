Requirements
============

To build the installer you must have installed izPack, see http://www.izpack.org

Note that it is important to have the IzPack lib files on your Ant classpath.

Build Setup
===========

It is likely that the one or two of the default settings in build.properties will 
not be suitable for your environment. Do not edit this file directly, instead create
a "local.build.properties" file and add any properties from "build.properties" that
you need to configure.  

More Info
