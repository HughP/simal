<shortdesc>The Contextual Resource Evaluation Environment (CREE) is a project arising from the Joint Information Systems Committee Portals: Investigations into User Requirements &amp; Sustainability invitation to tender. This seeks to build an environment where the portal developments within JISC can be tested within a variety of situations and establish how users interact with portals, and will help to inform the delivery of portals as services within the JISC Information Environment.</shortdesc>
