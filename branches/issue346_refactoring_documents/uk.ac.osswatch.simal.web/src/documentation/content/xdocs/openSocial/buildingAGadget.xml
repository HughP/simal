      Building an Open Social gadget for the Simal Web Module
    </title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The Simal Web module provides an open social container. This
      document describes how to create a new open social gadget for us
      in that container.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simal uses Shindig from the Apache incubator. This is the
      reference implementation of the Open Social standard.
    </p>

    <warning>
      Shindig is a fast moving target at present. Sometimes Simal lags
      behind Shindig in development and so Open Social features can
      break without warning. As Shinding and Simal stabalise we will
      settle on a working snapshot of Shindig, however, for now we are
      using the latest development versions of Shindig. In the event of
      a problem please join us on the
      <a href="ext:simal/devList">Simal developer mailing list</a>
      .
    </warning>

    <section>
      <title>Testing gadgets during development</title>

      <p>
        We've included both the stanard Shindig container and the
        samplecontainer. The later is used for testing gadgets in
        isolation and is available by requesting
        <code>
          http://localhost:8080/testContainer/samplecontainer.html
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        On that page enter
        <code>http://localhost:8080/gadgets/template.xml</code>
        intp the gadget URL field and hit reset.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should should see a gadget that allows Simal to say hello.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other example gadgets (provided by Shindig) that you may want to
        try out can be found at:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>
            http://localhost:8080/testContainer/examples/SocialHelloWorld.xml
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>
            http://localhost:8080/testContainer/examples/SocialActivitiesWorld.xml
          </code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To test your own gadget you simply need to enter the appropriate
        URL into the gadget URL field and hit reset.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating your first gadget</title>

      <p class="instrution">
        copy the file
        <code>src/gadgets/template.xml</code>
        to
        <code>src/gadgets/myGadget.xml</code>
      </p>

      <p class="instrution">
        enter http://localhost:8080/gadgets/myGadget.xml in the gadget
        URL field of
        <code>
          http://localhost:8080/testContainer/samplecontainer.html
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        You will see a simple hello world gadget that you can now
        customise.
      </p>

      <section>
        <title>Adding functionality to your gadget</title>

        <p class="instrution">
          Lets create a gadget to show all the people who work with the
          current user on any project. We'll do this by creating a
          <code>src/gadgets/friendsNavigator.xml</code>
          file (see previous section).
        </p>

        <note>
          The friendsNavigator.xml file is included with Simal, so if
          you intend to work along with this tutorial you will want to
          use a different name.
        </note>

        <p>
          We need to add code to our gadget to get a friends list from
          the container for the current viewer. This is documented in
          "Listing friends" in the
          <a
            href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/articles/tutorial/tutorial-0.7.html">
            Open Social Tutorial
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>Now we are ready to run the gadget in our container.</p>

        <p class="instrution">
          http://localhost:8080/testContainer/samplecontainer.html
        </p>

        <p class="instrution">
          enter
          <code>
            http://localhost:8080/gadgets/friendsNavigator.xml
          </code>
          into the "Displaying gadget" field
        </p>

        <p>Note that we do not use the "Using State" field.</p>

        <p class="instrution">
          enter 15 into both the Viewer id and Owner id fields
        </p>

        <p class="instrution">hit "reset all"</p>

        <p>You should see a sample list of friends</p>

        <note>
          the first time you run this request it will take a short while
          to generate the data request.
