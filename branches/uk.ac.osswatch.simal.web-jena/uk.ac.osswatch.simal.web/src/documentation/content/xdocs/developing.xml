    <title>Developing the Simal Web Module</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      This document describes how to get started with development of the
      Simal Web Module. It is intended for those users wishing to get
      their hands dirty with the
      <a href="ext:simal/svn">source code</a>
      .
    </p>

    <section>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <p>
        You must have set up the prerequisites and downloaded the source
        for Simal Web.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Building with Maven</title>

      <p>
        To build Simal Web application with Maven all you need to do is
        (from within your Simal Web home directory):
      </p>

      <source>
mvn war:war
</source>

      <p>This will build a war file in your SIMAL_WEB/target directory.</p>
      
      <p>Simal Web comes complete with a test suite, to run it you need:</p>

      <source>
mvn test
</source>
</section>

      <section>
        <title>Building Reports</title>

        <p>
          If you are working on the code of Simal Web then you will want
          to build the reports to check everything is OK, simply use:
        </p>

        <source>
mvn site
</source>

        <p>
          The site will be built in
          <code>SIMAL_WEB/target/site</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <title>Running Simal Web</title>

    <p>
      To run the Simal Web application you can either use the Maven
      Jetty plugin to run locally or you can deploy the war generated
      above in your favourite servlet engine. The later is outside the
      scope of this document, instead we will focus on running locally
      as part of your development cycle. To start the server run the
      following command:
    </p>

    <source>
mvn jetty:run
</source>

    <p>
      Now point your browser at
      <code>http://localhost:8080</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      An alternative way of starting a test version of the application
      is to use the class
      <code>uk.ac.osswatch.simal.wicket.Start</code>
      , found in the
      <code>src/test</code>
      directory. This class is useful when running within an IDE.

      <title>Now What?</title>

      <p>So you have Simal Web installed, now what?</p>

      <p>
        Simal is a very early stage project, we need your help. We
        encourage you to join our
        <a href="ext:simal/devList">mailing list</a>
