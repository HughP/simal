<shortdesc>The case studies will build on and complement the work of the e-Learning Models Desk Study. 
Case studies illustrating examples of "innovative" practice in relation to e-learning in the post-16 and HE community will be produced. 
The case studies will take the form of a written report with some supporting illustrative video clips showing actual practice, discussions with practitioners and learners. 
A publication drawing together the outcomes of this work will be launched in September to coincide with ALT-C.</shortdesc>
