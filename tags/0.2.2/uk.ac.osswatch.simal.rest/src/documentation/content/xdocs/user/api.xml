    <title>Simal REST API</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The Simal REST module provides a web application that exposes the
      Simal repository via a REST API.
    </p>

    <warning>
      This module is in an alpha state. The API is liable to change iun
      response to discussion on the
      <a href="ext:simal/devList">Simal developer mailing list</a>
      .
    </warning>

    <note>
      Our documentation is quite sparse at present. Please ask for help
      on our
      <a href="ext:simal/userList">mailing list</a>
      and we'll be sure to expand the documentation in response to your
      questions. Unless you ask, we don;t know what people need to see.
    </note>
