    <title>Tools</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>The tools menu provides access to a number of tools available for working with 
    Simal repositories. This document provides an overview of these tools.</p>
    
    <section>
      <title>Developer Tools</title>
      <p>The developer tools are provided to assist developers working
      on Simal. They are of little or no interest to most end-users.</p>
      
      <section>
        <title>Add Test Data</title>
        <p>This tool adds some useful test data to a repository.
        This is useful when creating a new repository instance and
        allows you to quickly add data set to the repository in
        a single click.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Pre-Alpha Tools</title>
      <p>These tools are in development and experimental. They
      may appear and disappear from release to release without
      warning. Furthermore, they may not actually work. These are only for
      the adventurous and certainly should not be relied upon
      in a production environment.</p>
      
      <p>For more information on any of these tools please
      see our <a href="ext:simal/devList">Developer mailing 
      list</a>.</p>
