<shortdesc>The three fully funded Lifelong Learning Networks in the NorthWest region, involving nine universities and a larger number of FECs, are working in partnership through this project to provide support to the vocational learners who are part of their client groups. Taking two employment sectors, Health and Social Care and Creative Industries, the project will develop an approach to personal development planning that can be later rolled out to other sectors. A learner portal for each sector will enable learners in employment to plan routes for their career and personal development, and provide ways to search for learning opportunities from multiple providers that fit their needs. E-portfolio facilities will help them present applications to enrol on courses, and "social software" will be explored as a means to give mentoring and peer support.</shortdesc>
