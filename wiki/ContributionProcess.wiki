#summary A checklist to use when making a contribution to Simal
#labels Featured

Simal is an open development project. This means that we accept contrbitutions from anyone. However, this does not mean that we will automatically include any contribution in our releases. This document provides a checklist to allow people to maximise the chances of their contribution being accepted by the project. 

The document is split into two sections, "Small Contributions" and "Major Contributions". For small contributions (e.g. spelling corrections or minor bug fixes) we have a lightweight process. However, for major contributions (e.g. new documents or features) we have a much more rigorous process.

= Small Contributions =

Small contributions are those unlikely to contain any intellectual properties, for example, a spelling correction, documentation clarification or small bug fix. That is, there are no significant legal concerns with accepting the contribution without validating the legal right of the author to make the contribution. Generally the process for submitting a small contribtuion is easy:

== Contributor Checklist ==

 # ensure all tests in all modules pass
 # create a patch for submission
 # find the appropriate issue in the tracker (or create a new one if necessary)
 # attach the patch to the issue with a comment explaining its purpose

*NOTE* by submitting the patch to the issue tracker you indicate that you transfer all copyright in the contribution to the University of Oxford. If you do not wish to transfer copyright then you must use the Major Contributions process below.

Once you have submitted the patch it will enter into our PatchReviewProcess

= Major Contributions =

A major contribution is a a significant change such as new feature, major bug fix or substantial documentation contribution and is likely to contain some intellectual property. We therefore require that a licence to use the copyright contained in the contribution is granted to the University of Oxford.

To do this we require that major contributions are accompanied by a statement assigning a licence to use the copyright. Note this statement does not transfer copyright to the University of Oxford, it merely grants us the right to use your copyrighted contribution. OSS Watch has a useful document on such [http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla.xml Contribtor Licence Agreements].

At the time of writing we have not yet drawn up a CLA, please see ISSUE 71 to track this issue. If you want to make a major contribution please follow the checklist above but indicate that you do not wish to transfer copyright and request that we draw up a CLA for you instead.
