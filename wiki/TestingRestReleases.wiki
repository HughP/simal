#summary A strategy for testing the REST module before release
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The document describes the *minimum* that you should do in order to test a build of the core module ready for release.

You are strongly encouraged to try variations around the themes outlined in this document. The more thorough you test the build, the less likely there will be a significant bug in the release.

== Preparation ==

You must have installed a Servlet engine on your machine, we suggest [http://www.mortbay.org/jetty Jetty] or [http://tomcat.apache.org Apache Tomcat]. Download the REST api war and drop it into your servlet container, then start up the container.
