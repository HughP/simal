=What is Simal=

Simal is a set of open source tools for building project catalogues from RDF/XML files.

Simal also provides a web application for the creation and management of RDF/XML project descriptors and catalogues built from them. 

_The project is very young at this time. As such, we welcome input into the requirements and design of the initial prototype system._

Why not have a play with our demo of the [http://registry.oss-watch.ac.uk early alpha release] and provide feedback on how you think we can [http://groups.google.com/group/simal-users improve it] (or even [http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors help us improve] it).

We have a [GettingStarted getting started document] for those looking to install the software locally and another for those wanting to work [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/userQuickstart.html install] the binaries. Please ask your questions on our [http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors mail list].

If you are unfamiliar with RDF and DOAP in particular, there is an [http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/doap.xml OSS Watch briefing note] on them. There is a demo of the current state of simal at http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/
