This page is intended for Admins, for those that have shell access to the Hudson Server.

==Starting, Stopping & Restarting Hudson.==

===Starting Hudson===

The Server has an init script written for Hudson and can be called with the command `etc/init.d/hudson start`.

This should only be needed on rare occasions, such as if Hudson was stopped manually, or if Hudson died. If the latter, one should should look into the LogFiles first to determine the cause.

===Stopping Hudson===

Before restarting Hudson you should Prepare Hudson For Shutdown first.
The same init script is used to stop Hudson - `/etc/init.d/hudson stop`.

You may need to stop Hudson to perform some maintenance tasks; or to Upgrade Hudson itself.

===Restarting Hudson===

Before restarting Hudson you should Prepare Hudson For Shutdown first.
Hudson is restarted by `/etc/init.d/hudson restart`.

Occasionally you may want to simply restart Hudson. For example you may be installing extra features or plugins.

===Hudson Status===

There is one more init script feature available - `/etc/init.d/hudson status`.

Just a handy way to determine if Hudson instance is running or not, a friendlier way of doing something like `ps auxwww | grep hudson` and gives you a _hudson is started | stopped_ comfort message.

==Extra Information==

===Log Files===

Hudson has its own log file located at `/var/log/hudson.log`. Currently this file is appended to by Hudson continuously, so we should probably be creating a cron job to rotate this weekly/monthly.

You can look at what is currently being output the Hudson log on the server by running the command `tail -f /var/log/hudson.log &'. Any log entries from then on when also be output to your shell screen. (You can continue to do other shell duties here, but beware that log entries will interupt your flow.) You can `ctrl c` out of this at any time.

==Preparing Hudson For Shutdown==

*_Ideally_* one should prepare Hudson for being stopped or restarted. This is done on the Admin area of the Hudson web interface. Log in as an administrator, go to 'Manage Hudson' then click on the 'Prepare For Shutdown' link near the bottom of the page. This does _not_ stop any currently running builds, but it does prevent any more scheduled ones from running. Your choice now is to either wait for currently running builds to finish, or stop them manually before then logging into the server and perfoming a Stop or Restart.
