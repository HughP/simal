= Introduction =

This page describes the Simal REST API. 

= Details =

==URL Structure==

All REST URLs are of the same form:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/COMMAND/NAME_VALUE_PAIRS/FORMAT}}}

Where COMMAND is the command you wish to execute, NAME_VALUE_PAIRS is zero or more parameter names and value pairs and FORMAT is a format code that specifies the format of the response document.

==Format==

Currently, only {{{json}}} and {{{xml}}} are supported as valid data FORMATs.

==Project Data==

===Add a project===

To add a project using a DOAP POST to:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/addProject}}}

The RDF project data should be contained in a parameter called rdf .

===Retrieve a Single Project===

To retrieve the details of a single project use:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/project/project-ID/FORMAT}}}

===All Projects===

To retrieve all projects from the standard SIMAL repository use:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/allProjects/FORMAT}}}

==Person Data==

==Retrieve a Single Person==

To retrieve the details of a single person use:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/person/person-ID/FORMAT}}}

===All Colleagues of a Person===

A colleague is defined as someone who works on any of the projects our target person works on.

To retrieve all colleagues from the standard SIMAL repository use:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/allColleagues/person-ID/FORMAT}}}

Where PERSON_ID is replaced with the Simal ID of the person we are interested in.

===Retrieve all People===

To retrieve the details of all people use:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/allPeople/FORMAT}}}

==Alternative Data Sources==

Simal can retrieve data from sources other than the standard Simal repository. Such as the MyExperiment social networking tool for scientific research. In order to use alternative data sources use the "source" parameter as follows:

{{{http://foo.com/simal-rest/allColleagues/source-myExperiment/PERSON-ID/FORMAT}}}
