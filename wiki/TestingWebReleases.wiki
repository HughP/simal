#summary A strategy for testing the web module before release
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The document describes the *minimum* that you should do in order to test a build of the web module ready for release.

You are strongly encouraged to try variations around the themes outlined in this document. The more thorough you test the build, the less likely there will be a significant bug in the release.

== Preparation ==

You must have installed a Servlet engine on your machine, we suggest [http://www.mortbay.org/jetty Jetty] or [http://tomcat.apache.org Apache Tomcat]. Download the web module war and drop it into your servlet container, then start up the container.

= Details =

== Start the webapp ==

=== Purpose of test ===

To ensure the webapp is running.

=== Commands ===

Start your webapp and then:

{{{
http://localhost:8080/simal-webapp-0.2
}}}

=== Expected behaviour ===

The homepage of the Simal webapp is displayed with no projects in the repostiory (note for there to be no projects present you need to be running in a new install, if you are upgrading you will have the same content as you previous install).
