#summary Steps to go through for a release
#labels Phase-Support,Phase-Implementation

*NOTE* This document refers to the process for 0.1, the core was redesigned for 0.2 and this document is no longer fully accurate. Pease update.

= Change src version numbers to reflect release candidate build =

We must first build a release candidate for testing. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean changing the postfix from "-SNAPSHOT" to "-rc1", "-rc2", "rc3" etc.

 * in {{{pom.xml}}} change {{{<version>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</version>}}}
 * in {{{src/main/resources/default.simal.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}

= Build the release candidate installer =

 * run {{{ant build}}} in the {{{simalInstaller}}} directory

This will build the installer, which can be found in {{{simal-Installer/dist/simal-x.y-POSTFIX.jar}}}

= Tag SVN =

SVN should be tagged with the release number in the format simal_x_y_z_POSTFIX

Note you should tag both the simal and the simal-installer trees.

= Upload to Google Code =

Upload the installer to the downloads section of Google Code, making the release candidate a featured download.

If this is a RC release then previous RC releases should be deleted (they use up the storage quota and can be rebuilt from SVN if people need to do so).

If this is a full release then deprecate the previous release.

= Test =

 * notify users/developers of new release candidate
 * as many people as possible should test the release candidate
 * all [http://code.google.com/p/simal/issues/list?can=6 closed issues awaiting] QA approval should be verified

= Vote =

Assuming that no critical errors are discovered during the testing phase we can now proceed with getting approval for the release.

A vote on the release is called on the contributor mailing list.

Assuming that the vote passes we can proceed. If it does not pass the reason(s) for the negative votes must be addressed.

= Change src version numbers =

We must now build a release package. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean changing the postfix from "-rc*" to "-ga"

 * in {{{pom.xml}}} change {{{<version>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</version>}}}
 * in {{{src/main/resources/default.simal.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}


= Package for release =

 * run {{{ant build}}} in the {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}}

= Tag SVN =

SVN needs to be tagged with the release information, typically, this will look something like:

"simal_x_y_z"

Note you should tag both the simal and the simal-installer trees.

= Upload to Google Code =

Upload to the downloads section of Google Code, making the release candidate a featured download.

Remove the release candidate upload from the downloads section.

= Update RoadMap =

The RoadMap indicates the status of each release. Once an release candidate has been built this should be noted in the status column of the RoadMap table. typically the entry will read something like "released DD/MM/YYYY".

= Change src version numbers =

We must now build a release package. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean incrementing the minor version number and changing the postfix from "-ga" to "-dev"

 * in {{{pom.xml}}} change {{{<version>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</version>}}}
 * in {{{src/main/resources/default.simal.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}
