= Change src version numbers to reflect release candidate build =

We must first build a release candidate for testing. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean changing the postfix from "-dev" to "-rc1", "-rc2", "rc3" etc.

 * in {{{simalIntaller/simal-install.xml}}} change {{{<appversion>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</appversion>}}}
 * in {{{build.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}

= Build the release candidate installer =

 * run {{{ant build}}} in the {{{simalIntaller}}} directory

This will build the installer, which can be found in {{{simal-Intaller/dist/simal-x.y-POSTFIX.jar}}}

= Upload to Google Code =

Upload the installer to the downloads section of Google Code, making the release candidate a featured download.

= Update RoadMap =

The RoadMap indicates the status of each release. Once an release candidate has been built this should be noted in the status column of the RoadMap table. typically the entry will read something like "RC1 in testing".

= Test =

 * notify users/developers of new release candidate
 * as many people as possible should test the release candidate
 * all [http://code.google.com/p/simal/issues/list?can=6 closed issues awaiting] QA approval should be verified

= Change src version numbers =

We must now build a release package. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean changing the postfix from "-rc*" to "-ga"

 * in {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}} change {{{<appversion>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</appversion>}}}
 * in {{{build.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}


= Package for release =

 * run {{{ant build}}} in the {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}}

= Tag SVN =

SVN needs to be tagged with the releae information, typically, this will look something like:

"release-0.1"

= Upload to Google Code =

Upload to the downloads section of Google Code, making the release candidate a featured download.

Remove the release candidate upload from the downloads section.

= Update RoadMap =

The RoadMap indicates the status of each release. Once an release candidate has been built this should be noted in the status column of the RoadMap table. typically the entry will read something like "released DD/MM/YYYY".

= Change src version numbers =

We must now build a release package. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean incrementing the minor version number and changing the postfix from "-ga" to "-dev"

 * in {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}} change {{{<appversion>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</appversion>}}}
 * in {{{build.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}
