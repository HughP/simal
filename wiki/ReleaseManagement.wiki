#labels Phase-Support,Phase-Implementation

= Change src version numbers to reflect release candidate build =

We must first build a release candidate for testing. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean changing the postfix from "-dev" to "-rc1", "-rc2", "rc3" etc.

 * in {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}} change {{{<appversion>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</appversion>}}}
 * in {{{build.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}

= Build the release candidate installer =

*FIXME:* Note that this is not working yet, this page documents the process as it is intended to be.

 * run {{{ant build}}} in the {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}}

= Upload to Google Code =

Upload to the downloads section of Google Code, making the release candidate a featured download

= Test =

 * notify users/developers of new release candidate
 * as many people as possible should test the release candidate

= Change src version numbers =

We must now build a release package. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean changing the postfix from "-rc*" to "-ga"

 * in {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}} change {{{<appversion>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</appversion>}}}
 * in {{{build.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}


= Package for release =

 * run {{{ant build}}} in the {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}}

= Upload to Google Code =

Upload to the downloads section of Google Code, making the release candidate a featured download

= Change src version numbers =

We must now build a release package. To do this we need to correctly set the version number. Usually this will mean incrementing the minor version number and changing the postfix from "-ga" to "-dev"

 * in {{{simal-sintall/simal-install.xml}}} change {{{<appversion>x.y.z[-POSTFIX]</appversion>}}}
 * in {{{build.properties}}} change {{{simal.version=x.y.z[-POSTFIX]}}}
