== Get Source Files ==

{{{
svn checkout http://simal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk
}}}

where $PROJECT_HOME is your chosen project directory

NOTE: Use https rather than http if you are a committer

=== Installing ===

The installation process is not as streamlined as it should be right now. However, we are working on it and welcome your help.

==== Core ====
{{{
cd $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core
mvn install
}}}

==== REST ====

{{{
cd $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.rest
mvn install
}}}

==== Web Application ====

Now you need to configure the webapp for your server. 

Create a file called {{{local.simal.properties}}} in {{{$PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.web}}} and open it in your favourite editor. This file contains the local configuation for your web application.

As a minimum you must set the following properties:

{{{
simal.user.webapp.baseurl=http://foo.org:8080
simal.rest.baseurl=http://foo.org:8080/simal-rest
}}}

Other configuration proerties are available. See {{{$PROJECT_HOME/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core/src/main/resources/default.simal.properties}}} for details.

_Yes, we know_ the default webapp properties should be set in the webapp module. See issue 118

(Note that Simal Web does not need to be installed)

== Running ==

Simal is made up of three components and therefore can be accessed in three ways. Each of these is described below in order of usefulness to the average user (or reverse order for the average developer).

Note, in all these cases the documentation is currently held in SVN, we've not got around to publishing it yet.

=== Simal Web Application ===

The Simal web module provides a web application that provides a GUI interface to a Simal repostory. [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/web/developing.html Instructions for running the webapp] can be found in svn.

=== Simal Rest ===

Simal rest is a module providing a REST API to Simal. Instructions for [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/rest/index.html running and accessing the REST API] are in SVN.

=== Simal Core ===

Simal core is the back end systems. It contains the data model, data services and repository. Simal core provides a command line interface.

The documentation for [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/core/developing.html running Simal core] can be found at in svn. We'll get around to publishing it one day.
