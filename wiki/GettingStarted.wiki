This document describes how to download and run the various components of Simal. It does not describe the set-up of a development environment, this is a task left for the reader (although we do have a document describing how to [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/contributor/developSimal.html set up Eclipse]).

If you have any problems you could try looking at our [FAQ] or asking questions on our [http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors mailing list].

== Pre-Requisites ==

 * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/previous.jsp Java JDK] 1.5+ 
 * [http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html Subversion]
  * You may prefer to use a GUI to work with Subversion, such as [http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/ RapidSVN]
 * [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Apache Maven]

== Get Source Files ==

{{{
svn checkout http://simal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk
}}}

where $PROJECT_HOME is your chosen project directory

NOTE: Use https rather than http if you are a committer

=== Installing ===

The installation process is not as streamlined as it should be right now. However, we are working on it and welcome your help.

==== Core ====
{{{
cd $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core
mvn install
}}}

==== REST ====

{{{
cd $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.rest
mvn install
}}}

==== Web Application ====

Now you need to configure the webapp for your server. 

Create a file called {{{local.simal.properties}}} in {{{$PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.web}}} and open it in your favourite editor. This file contains the local configuation for your web application.

As a minimum you must set the following properties:

{{{
simal.user.webapp.baseurl=http://localhost:8080
simal.rest.baseurl=http://localhost:8080/simal-rest
}}}

Other configuration proerties are available. See {{{$PROJECT_HOME/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core/src/main/resources/default.simal.properties}}} for details.

== Running ==

Simal is made up of three components and therefore can be accessed in three ways. Each of these is described below in order of usefulness to the average user (or reverse order for the average developer).

Note, in all these cases the documentation is currently held in SVN, we've not got around to publishing it yet.

=== Simal Web Application ===

The Simal web module provides a web application that provides a GUI interface to a Simal repostory. [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/web/developing.html Instructions for running the webapp] are available in the webapp docs (hint "mvn jetty:run" after installing the core and rest modules in your Maven repository - see above).

The default admin username and password is "simal", you can change this in the local.simal.properties file.

==== Debug Mode ====

To run the web application in debug mode using JDPA run the command:

{{{
export MAVEN_OPTS='-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n'
}}}

After setting this property, run "maven jetty:run" and connect your debugger to port 8000. If "suspend=y" is used, it will will block, waiting for a debug connection.


=== Simal Rest ===

Simal rest is a module providing a REST API to Simal. Instructions for [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/rest/index.html running and accessing the REST API] are available in the REST module docs (hint "mvn jetty:run" after installing the core module in your Maven repository - see above).

=== Simal Core ===

Simal core is the back end systems. It contains the data model, data services and repository. Simal core provides a command line interface.

See the documentation for [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/core/developing.html running Simal core] via the command line.
