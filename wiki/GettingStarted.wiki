#summary Basic getting started instructions
#labels Featured,Phase-Support

You can get started from the latest binary release or the development source code. Both are fairly easy to get going with, but the binary install has less pre-requisities (although you don't need anything an average Java develop has already)

= Binary Release =

== Pre-Requisites ==

 * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/previous.jsp Java JDK] 1.4 - 1.5 (1.6 currently unsupported)

== Get the Binary Download ==

Get the latest binary download from the [http://code.google.com/p/simaldownloads/list project downloads page].

The download is an executable jar, on most operating systems you can simply double click on the downloaded file. If this does not work then run the command (replacing x.y.z) with the relevant version number for your download:

{{{
java -jar simal-x.y.z.jar
}}}

This will run a cross platform installer, so just follow the instructions on screen.

== Set up ==

Create a SIMAL_HOME environment to point at the directory where you installed the Siaml software.

Add $SIMAL_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable

== Running ==

That's it you have installed Simal. Time to perform your FirstRun.
