*NOTE* After an initial prototype that demonstrated the potential direction for Simal (release 0.1) we started development of 0.2 using a more suitable underlying framework. We are currently in the process of moving from the old system to the new. This document addresses 0.1. The notes on the binry release are still correct, but the source release information is not currently accurate. We'll address that one the move is complete, if you can't wait, take a look at the [http://code.google.com/p/simal/source/browse/trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core/src/site/apt/developing.apt install docs for the new version] and join our mailing list and we'll help,

You can get started from the latest binary release or the development source code. Both are fairly easy to get going with, but the binary install has less pre-requisities (although for the source releases you don't need anything an average Java developer has already).

If you have any problems you could try looking at our [FAQ].

= Binary Release =

== Pre-Requisites ==

 * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/previous.jsp Java JDK] 1.4 - 1.5 (1.6 currently unsupported)

== Get the Binary Download ==

Get the latest binary download from the [http://code.google.com/p/simal/downloads/list project downloads page].

The download is an executable jar, on most operating systems you can simply double click on the downloaded file. If this does not work then run the command (replacing x.y.z) with the relevant version number for your download:

{{{
java -jar simal-x.y.z.jar
}}}

This will run a cross platform installer, so just follow the instructions on screen.
== Set up ==

Create a SIMAL_HOME environment to point at the directory where you installed the Simal software.

Add $SIMAL_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable

== Running ==

That's it you have installed Simal. Time to perform your FirstRun.

= Latest Developer Sources =

== Eclipse Development ==

If you use Eclipse as your development environment you may want to start with our [http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/contributor/how-to/developSimal.html "Configuring Eclipse"] document, this describes how to set up Eclipse for Simal development.

Otherwise you will need to read the information below. we welcome documentation on how to set up other development environments.

== Pre-Requisites ==

 * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/previous.jsp Java JDK] 1.4 - 1.5 (1.6 currently unsupported)
 * [http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html Subversion] (on !RedHat run {{{yum install subversion}}})
 * [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi Apache Ant] (on !RedHat run {{{yum install ant}}})

== Get Source Files ==

{{{
svn checkout http://simal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk
}}}

where $PROJECT_HOME is your chosen project directory

NOTE: Use https rather than http if you are a committer

== Set up ==

Create a SIMAL_HOME environment variable with the value $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/simal

Add $SIMAL_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable

Run the following commands:

{{{
cd $SIMAL_HOME
ant install
}}}


== Running ==

That's it you have installed Simal. Time to perform your FirstRun.
