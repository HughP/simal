*NOTE* After an initial prototype that demonstrated the potential direction for Simal (release 0.1) we started development of 0.2 using a more suitable underlying framework. We are currently in the process of moving from the old system to the new. Consequently this document points to numerous other documents in SVN, we welcome your help in making this document more useful for newcomers.

If you have any problems you could try looking at our [FAQ] or asking questions on our [http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors mailing list].

== Get Source Files ==

{{{

where $PROJECT_HOME is your chosen project directory

=== Installing ===

The installation process is not as streamlined as it should be right now. However, we are working on it and welcome your help.

For now there are two steps:
{{{
cd $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core
mvn install
}}}

Once this installation is succesful do the following:

{{{
cd $PROJECT_HOME/simal-trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.rest
mvn install
}}}

(Note that Simal Web does not need to be installed)

== Running ==

Simal is made up of three components and therefore can be accessed in three ways. Each of these is described below in order of usefulness to the average user (or reverse order for the average developer).

Note, in all these cases the documentation is currently held in SVN, we've not got around to publishing it yet.

=== Simal Web Application ===

The Simal web module provides a web application that provides a GUI interface to a Simal repostory. [http://simal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.web/src/site/apt/developing.apt Instructions for running the webapp] can be found in svn.

=== Simal Rest ===

Simal rest is a module providing a REST API to Simal. Instructions for [http://simal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.rest/src/site/apt/index.apt running and accessing the REST API] are in SVN.

=== Simal Core ===

Simal core is the back end systems. It contains the data model, data services and repository. Simal core provides a command line interface.

The documentation for [http://simal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core/src/site/apt/developing.apt running Simal core] can be found at in svn. We'll get around to publishing it one day.
