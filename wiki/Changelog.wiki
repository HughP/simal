=== Add Multiple Projects from Ohloh.net ===

The Command Line interface can now accept a filename instead of a project ID, e.g.

{{{
importOhloh -f FILENAME
}}}

This file contains one Ohloh project ID per line (or a comment if the line starts with '#'). All projects listed in this file will be imported into the database. For example:

{{{
################################
# Projects to import from Ohloh
################################

simal

# Apache projects
apache
forrest
}}}
