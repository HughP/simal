= 0.2.3-SNAPSHOT =

== Core ==

=== Jena backend ===

 * Jena is updated to version 2.6.2. to be compatible with Joseki and to allow use of other Jena backend types
 * Added support to SDB and TDB backends. See [http://jena.sourceforge.net/documentation.html Jena documentation] for details
 * Backend used at runtime can be configured using the property {{{ simal.db.type }}}
 * All properties (as defined in the property files) can now be overruled by using a system property (eg. at startup: {{{-Dsimal.db.type=TDB }}})

=== SPARQL Endpoint ===

 * Add JOSEKI SPARQL server (see http://www.joseki.org/)
 * FIXME: is this endpoint accessible as described in http://joseki.org/protocol.html If not we need an issue to get this done in a future release

=== Add Multiple Projects from Ohloh.net ===

The Command Line interface can now accept a filename instead of a project ID, e.g.

{{{
importOhloh -f FILENAME
}}}

This file contains one Ohloh project ID per line (or a comment if the line starts with '#'). All projects listed in this file will be imported into the database. For example:

{{{
################################
# Projects to import from Ohloh
################################

simal

# Apache projects
apache
forrest
}}}
