= Why won't the installaer JAR execute? =

If the installer fails to launch, a likely problem is that the Java install is not being found, or the version installed is to old. You must ensure the correct version (defined in the GettingStarted document) and, if necessary, point to it using:

{{{
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/
}}}

Obviously the path to the install will vary depending on where java lives on your system.
