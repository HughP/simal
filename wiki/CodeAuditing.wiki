#summary A description of code auditing in Simal
= Introduction =

Simal uses a number of tools to check source code for common issues. This document describes the audit tools in use and what they tell us.

= Licence Audit =

[http://incubator.apache.org/rat RAT] is used to audit source files for correct licence headers and other legal requiremets.

RAT is run every time we try and do an install of a Simal artifact. If any problems occur the build will be aborted and an error message shown.

The report from RAT is output to {{{target/rat.txt}}} this will give more information about any problems found.

RAT can be run manually with the command:

{{{mvn rat:check}}}

== Adding Licence Headers ==

RAT can also be used to automatically add licence headers.
