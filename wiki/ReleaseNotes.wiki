We are pleased to announce the release of Simal v0.2-rc1

Simal is a framework for building project registries. Using Simal you can quickly collate details about projects and participants. This data can then be accessed via a command line tool for scripting, a RESTful API for mashups or a web application for humans.

This release is a complete rewrite of the 0.1 release which was always intended to be a proof of concept. 0.2 now utilises an RDF repository rather than a flat file system. Consequnetly performance is vastly improved in this release.

Key features include:

- Ability to import DOAP from the local filesystem or a remote URL
- AJAX browsers for finding people or projects
- Fully categorised listings
- Export of RDF data models
- RESTful API
