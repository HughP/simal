This is an example procedure for the Apache Forrest project.

The relicense task is described at
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-123

Before commencing, do 'tree -d > relicense-tree.txt' which will form
a listing of what sections have already been done and the issues that remain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Do the whole tree, a section at a time, using insert_license.pl script.
* cd to a directory as high as you dare, e.g. src/documentation/
* In another window, do a practice run:
insert_license.pl -p \
/path/to/svn/forrest/src/documentation forrest-avoid.txt > relicense.log
* Review the summary output and grep the relicence.log file.
* Investigate the files that are listed as having problems.
* grep for special patterns like "WARN" and "dual license", etc.
* grep "Insert new license" to see which files would have a license inserted.
* You may need to add more filename patterns to your *-avoid.txt file.
* Do more practice runs.
* When happy, do a production run by ommitting the -p practice mode.
* Again review the summary output and grep the relicence.log file.
* Some files may need to be fixed by hand.
* Note sections that are finished and remaining issues in relicense-tree.txt
* Do a 'svn diff' and make sure it is what you expected, then 'svn commit'.

* If the log reveals that there are old Apache Licenses, then use the
  script ./update_AL20.pl

* Tweak the insert_license.pl script to address new issues.
