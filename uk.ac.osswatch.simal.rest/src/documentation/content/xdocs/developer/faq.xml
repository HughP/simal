      <question>
        How do I create a REST URL programmatically"
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>First you need to <a href="#createCommand">create</a>
        a <code>RESTCommand</code> object. Then use the
        <code>getPath()</code> method to return the path
        of the URL, or the <code>getURL()</code> method to
        get the full URL.</p>
      </answer>

    <faq id="createCommand">
      <question>
        How do I create a REST command programmtically?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Use the <code>RESTCommand.create*</code> helper 
        methods. If there is no helper method for the command
        you wish to create then use 
        <code>RESTCommand.createCommand(url)</code>, where
        <code>url</code> is the path of the URL you would
        normally use.</p>
        
        <p>Note that there are a number of constants in the
        <code>RESTCommand</code> class that can be used to
        construct the URL in the latter case.</p>
        
        <note>The use of <code>RESTCommand.createCommand(url)</code>
        is discouraged because it does not protect your application
        from changes in the URL scheme during alpha stages of
        development.</note>
