    <title>Welcome to Simal REST Module</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The Simal REST module provides a web application that exposes the
      Simal repository via a REST API.
    </p>

    <warning>
      This module is in an alpha state. The API is liable to change iun
      response to discussion on the
      <a href="ext:simal/devList">Simal developer mailing list</a>
      .
    </warning>
    
    <note>Our documentation is quite sparse at present. Please ask
    for help on our <a href="ext:simal/userList">mailing list</a> and
    we'll be sure to expand the documentation in response to your 
    questions. Unless you ask, we don;t know what people need to
    see.</note>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      
      <note>The <a href="ext:simal/webModule">Simal Web</a> module 
      includes the Simal REST module by default.
      You may want to start your experiments with that since it provides
      a human as well as amchine interface to the repository.</note> 

      <ul>
        <li>
          Simal REST uses
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
          to manage its dependencies. This means that you only need to
          ensure your system has the following items installed,
          everything else will be downloaded automatically.
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://www.java.com">Java</a>
          (JDK 1.5 or higher)
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven</a>
        </li>

        <li>Simal Core (see below)</li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <title>Simal Core</title>

        <p>
          Simal REST uses
          <a href="ext:simal/coreModule">Simal Core</a>
          an open source framework for storage, inferencing and querying
          of project and community data.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use the latest code, during development, from this project.
          Therefore it is necessary for you to download the source for
          <a href="ext:simal/coreModule/download">
            Simal Core download
          </a>
          . If you are working with Maven you will also need to install
          Simal Core in your local repository. At some point we'll
          simplify this set up, but at the time of writing we are new to
          Maven and have not yet figured out the best configuration, if
          you know Maven we would welcome your
          <a href="ext:simal/devList">help</a>
          .

      <title>Getting the Source</title>

      <p>
        The source code of Simal REST is available from our
        <a href="ext:simal/svn">Subversion repository</a>
        .

      <title>Now What?</title>

      <p>
        This is a very early stage project and we welcome your
        assistance in testing, development and documentation. All we
        have so far is below:

    <section>
      <title>Running the REST webapp</title>

      <p>
        There are two ways of running the REST API for testing,
        either...
      </p>

      <source>mvn jetty:run</source>

      <p>
        Then point your browser at
        <code>http://localhost:8080/simal-rest</code>
      </p>

      <p>or...</p>

      <p>
        Run the
        <code>src/test/java/uk/ac/osswatch/simal/rest/Start</code>
        class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then point your browser at
        <code>http://localhost:8880/simal-rest</code>
      </p>
      
      <p>The commands available in the REST API are 
      <a href="user/api.html">documented</a>
      in our user section.</p>
