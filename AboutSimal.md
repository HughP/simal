Simal is a set of open source tools for building project catalogues from RDF/XML files.

Simal also provides a web application for the creation and management of RDF/XML project descriptors and catalogues built from them.

The mission of the Simal project is to create a software framework for the collection and management of essential details about open development projects. Using this data it will be possible to create a picture of development projects and communities, that allows for all increased awareness of existing projects and experts to be found within.

**_The project is very young at this time. As such, we welcome input into the requirements and design of the initial prototype system._**

Why not have a play with our demo of the [early alpha release](http://registry.oss-watch.ac.uk) and provide feedback on how you think we can [improve it](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-users) (or even [help us improve](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors) it).

We have a [getting started document](UserQuickStart.md) for those looking to install the software locally using the binaries and [another](GettingStarted.md) for those wanting to work directly from the latest source code. Feel free to ask all your questions on our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors).

If you are unfamiliar with RDF and DOAP in particular, there is an [OSS Watch briefing note](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/doap.xml) on them. There is a demo of the current state of simal at http://registry.oss-watch.ac.uk/

## Why Simal? ##

A Simal is an East Indian silk cotton tree of the Bombax genus. These trees have extremely large root and branch systems and strong, but short trunks.

We felt that Simal, the software project, was somewhat like the trunk of these trees. That is, Simal channels the goodness available in fertile planting grounds to the projects that bear fruit up in the branches of the tree.

We also felt that as Simal (the project) matures it is likely to develop a number of strong supporting branches for specific community types.

For more information (and a picture) see the wikipedia entry on [Bombax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simal).
