        <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Simal is an open source framework for building systems for use by those
    who need to inform a community about the activities of multiple projects
    that may be hosted in multiple locations. Each project maintains an entry 
    within the Simal project catalogue by means of an RDF/XML file. This entry 
    contains a description of what the project is doing, team members, community 
    structure, deliverables, etc. Simal uses this file to gather a range of 
    information about the projects and presents it in various forms to suit 
    a variety of uses, such as a web site, or PDF document.</p>
      
      <p>Simal also provides a web application for the creation and management
      of catalogues built using this system. This application allows users to
      identity projects of interest to their community and generate customised 
      catalogues for their own use, within their own projects website.</p>
            
      <p>The generated catalogues present a useful community 
      development and support tool. They enable users to 
      quickly and easily track activity in multiple related projects from 
      a single location. Thus a project's outputs are visible beyond its
      immediate community. By exposing relevant outputs to a wider community
      we hope to increase the level of interaction between related projects.</p>
      
      <p>The project is very young at this time. As
      such, we welcome input into the requirements and design of the
      initial prototype system.</p>

        <title>Project Registry</title>
        <p>The project registry is built by importing Description of a Project (DOAP)
          files into an RDF repository. This catalogue can then be used to
          find relationships (either existing or potential) between projects 
          and their participants.</p>
        
        <section>
          <title>Status</title>
          <p>The registry is currently at an early stage of development,
          we welcome requests for features via our 
          <a href="ext:simal/userList">mailing lists</a>.
          For more information about the current status see our 
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simal/issues/list">issue tracker</a>
          and <a href="/changes.html">recent changes</a>

        <title>Management Web Application</title>
      <p>Once made available to the system these DOAP files
          are aggregated and presented in various ways that allow a catalogue of
          projects to be presented and manipulated. 
          
          We host a <a href="http://data.oss-watch.ac.uk:8080/">demo server</a> which runs a 
          version of Simal that reflects the latest developments. </p>
