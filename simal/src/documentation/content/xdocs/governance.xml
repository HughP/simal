    <body>

        <p>Simal is a consensus-based community project. Our governance model is
    inspired by that used within <a href="http://www.apache.org">The Apache Software Foundation</a> projects.
    Anyone with an interest in Simal can contribute to the project's
    design, documentation and strategy. Anyone can join the project
    community and participate in the decision-making process.</p>
        <p>For further information on the Simal project's goverance model see <a href="contributor/governance/index.html">contributor/governance</a></p>
