  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>This section of the site contains a number of how-to documents aimed at
    contributors of all types. See the links in the menu on the left for more
    details.</p>
    
    <p>A how to document describes how to perform a specific task. 
    It is not intended to provide the reader with in-depth
    knowledge about that task, instead it provides a step-by-step guide
    describing how to perform the task. A good how to will point the
    reader at more detailed documentation wherever possible, thus allowing
    a reader to choose between understanding how to achieve a task and
    fully understanding why each step is required.</p>
