        <p>Simal is a community project, our governance model is similar to that
          found within Apache Software Foundation projects.Decisions about 
          the future of the project are made through discussion
          with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most
          experienced developer. Usually, gaining consensus within the community
          is easy since all community members have a common set of interests.
          However, when consensus cannot be easily gained through discussion
          there are voting procedures in place, binding votes are awarded to
          those who demonstrate an understanding of the projects objectives
          and governance model.</p>
