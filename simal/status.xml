        Added a <code>uk.ac.osswatch.simal.rest</code> Equinox bundle that
        provides a REST API to access the simal application. This API will
        provide access to common functionality, requests are made in the
        URLspace <code>/rest/*</code>.<br/>
        The first method available is <code>/rest/doap/[ID]</code> which will
        return a DOAP representation of the project identified with the ID
        used. This ID is either the numeric ID from the database or the shortname
        of the project.

          <p>Simal is a framework for building systems for use by organisations that need to inform
            the communities around a group of related projects. The project is very young at this
            time, as such we welcome input into the requirements and design of the initial prototype
            system.</p>

        Add a simal theme (found in the <code>/seed/theme</code> directory).
        This is still very rough and has some glaring problems with it, but
        it's a start and makes things easier for those not used to Forrest.<br/>
        To apply the theme to an existing simal project run <code>simal seed-theme</code>

        <code>seed-theme</code>, adds the simal theme to the current content

        Existing experimental work on Wicket based admin application removed.

        uk.ac.osswatch.simal.webGUI.
        <br/>
        This switch allows a much more powerful GUI for the webapp, and also
        gives us the flexibility to create a desktop client that looks close
        to identical if we so desire in the future. Here's a screenshot of the
        first iteration. (yes this really is a screenshot of the webapp!)
