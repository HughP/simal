          <title>What is Simal?</title>

          <p>Simal is a framework for building systems for use by organisations that need to inform
            the communities around a group of related projects. The project is very young at this
            time, as such we welcome input into the requirements and design of the initial prototype
            system.</p>
          <p>This release focuses integrating data from third parties with Simal and on
          providing data in machine readable formats for third parties.</p>

      <action context="admin" dev="RDG" type="update" importance="low">
        Extracted Simal theme into a standalone plugin (uk.ac.osswatch.forrest.themes).
      </action>
      <action context="catalogue" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        Configured an IzPack installer for easy installation of Simal. See
        the simalInstaller module in SVN. Configuration is in simal/etc/installer.

      <action context="catalogue" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        Apache Forrest is now bundled with Simal, there is no need to install it
        separately.
      </action>
      <action context="catalogue" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        Add a simal theme (found in the <code>/seed/theme</code> directory).
        This is still very rough and has some glaring problems with it, but
        it's a start and makes things easier for those not used to Forrest.<br/>
        To apply the theme to an existing simal project run <code>simal seed-theme</code>
      </action>
      <action context="webapp" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="medium">
        Add writeDOAP(OutputStream out) method to project model.
      </action>
      <action context="catalogue" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        Added build scripts that allow users to seed content. Initial seeds targets
        are <code>seed-basic</code>, a simple site with minimal content and a
        base catalgoue to get started with, this uses.
        <code>seed-theme</code>, adds the simal theme to the current content
        object
        <code>seed-event</code>, a seed site used for creating catagloues
        relating to attendees at an event.<br/>
        To use any of these seeds use the command <code>simal [SEED_NAME]</code>
      </action>
      <action context="catalogue" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        Added a wrapper around the Forrest command to allow Simal extensions
        to the forrest command set. All Forrest commands can now be run as
        <code>simal [COMMNAND]</code> 
      </action>
      <action context="docs" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="medium">
        Added a credits page in which we should add any creidts required
        by licenses or good practice.
      </action>
      <action context="webapp" dev="RDG" type="update" importance="high">
        Existing experimental work on Wicket based admin application removed.
        Replaced with Eclipse RAP based application which is built into two
        separate plugins called uk.ac.osswatch.simal.model and
        uk.ac.osswatch.simal.webGUI.
        <br/>
        This switch allows a much more powerful GUI for the webapp, and also
        gives us the flexibility to create a desktop client that looks close
        to identical if we so desire in the future. Here's a screenshot of the
        first iteration. (yes this really is a screenshot of the webapp!)

        that the management webapp can now be self hosting. Just do <code>ant run</code> and point

        to view the management webapplication. </action>
