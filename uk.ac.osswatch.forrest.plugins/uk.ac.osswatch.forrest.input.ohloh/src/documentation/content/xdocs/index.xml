                Apache Forrest - uk.ac.osswatch.forrest.input.ohloh
                Plugin
            </title>
            <p>
        Accesses the OhLoh.net APi to extract useful information about a project from their database.
      </p>
      
      <warning>This plugin has very little functionality at this time since the OhLoh API itself is
      extremely limited. In fact, the plugin doesn't even provide valid XDocs for further processing
      by Forrest. it is really only useful in conjunction with <code>uk.ac.osswatch.forrest.output.doap</code>
      which can generate DOAP files from OhLoh data. These DOAP files can, in turn, be used by the Forrest
      DOAP plugin to create sensible content.</warning>

      <p>
        This section includes links to a number of samples using this plugin.
        The plugin is intended to be self documenting through these samples. If
