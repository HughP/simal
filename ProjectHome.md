**This project is no longer actively maintained. The main reason is that the maintainers have moved on. There is some useful stuff in here. If you want to pick it up then just let us know.**

Simal is a set of open source tools for building project catalogues from RDF/XML files.

Simal also provides a web application for the creation and management of RDF/XML project descriptors and catalogues built from them.

The mission of the Simal project is to create a software framework for the collection and management of essential details about open development projects. Using this data it will be possible to create a picture of development projects and communities, that allows for all increased awareness of existing projects and experts to be found within.

**_The project is in late alpha stages, it is functional and useful, but has some warts and workarounds. As such, we welcome [input](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors) into the requirements, design and functionality of the application._**

Why not have a play with our demo of the [early alpha release](http://registry.oss-watch.ac.uk) and provide feedback on how you think we can [improve it](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-users) (or even [help us improve](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors) it).

We have a [getting started document](UserQuickStart.md) for those looking to install the software locally using the binaries and [another](GettingStarted.md) for those wanting to work directly from the latest source code. Feel free to ask all your questions on our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/simal-contributors).

If you are unfamiliar with RDF and DOAP in particular, there is an [OSS Watch briefing note](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/doap.xml) on them. There is a demo of the current state of simal at http://registry.oss-watch.ac.uk/
