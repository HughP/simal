                Apache Forrest - uk.ac.osswatch.forrest.input.ohloh
                Plugin
            </title>
            <p>
        Accesses the Sourceforge.net site to extract useful information about a project from their database.
        Sourceforge does not provide an API for extracting data and so this plugin uses a number of tricks such
        as reading RSS feeds and converting them into a useful format such as DOAP.
      </p>
      
      <p>To request project details you need the sourceforge groupid for the project. This can be
      found by examining the URL of almost any sourceforge page for your desired project, other than its home
      page.</p>

      <p>
        This section includes links to a number of samples using this plugin.
        The plugin is intended to be self documenting through these samples. If
        you require further help please ask on the user mailing list.
