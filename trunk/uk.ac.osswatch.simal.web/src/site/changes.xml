      <action dev="rdg" type="add">
        Added a gadget panel that allows Google Gadgets or Open Social Gadgets
        to be embedded in a Simal page. At present this requires a gadget
        server to be running at localhost:8888/gadgets with the necessary
        javascript files in localhost:8888/gadgets/files/container. The easiest
        way to make this happen is to checkout Shindig and run 
        "mvn -Djetty.port=8888 jetty:run". It is intended to remove this
        requirement at some point in the future, see ISSUE 83 to track progress.
