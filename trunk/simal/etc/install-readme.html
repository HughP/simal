<title>Simal - a project catalogue tool</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to Simal</h1>

<p>Simal is a set of open source tools for building project
catalogues from RDF/XML files.</p>

<p>Simal also provides a web application for the creation and
management of RDF/XML project descriptors and catalogues built from
them.</p>

<p>The project is very young at this time. As such, we welcome input
into the requirements and design of the initial prototype system.</p>
