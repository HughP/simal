    <title>Why Simal?</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>A Simal is an East Indian silk cotton tree of the Bombax genus.
    These trees have extremely large root and branch systems and strong, 
    but short trunks.</p>
    
    <p>We felt that Simal, the software project, was somewhat like the
    trunk of these trees. That is, Simal channels the goodness available
    in fertile planting grounds to the projects that bear fruit up in the
    branches of the tree.</p>
    
    <p>We also felt that as Simal (the project) matures it is likely to
    develop a number of strong supporting branches for specific community
    types.</p> 
    
    <p>For more information (and a picture) see the wikipedia entry
    on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simal">Bombax</a>.</p>
