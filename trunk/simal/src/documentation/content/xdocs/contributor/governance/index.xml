        <title>Simal Project Governance</title>
    </header>
    <body>

        <p>Simal is a consensus-based community project. Our governance model is
    inspired by that used within <a href="http://www.apache.org">The Apache Software Foundation</a> projects.
    Anyone with an interest in Simal can contribute to the project's
    design, documentation and strategy. Anyone can join the project
    community and participate in the decision-making process.</p>

      <title>Community Roles</title>
      
        <section>
            <title>Users</title>

            <p>Users are community members who have a need for Simal. Anyone can be a
            user, there are no special requirements. Users are the most important
            members of our community, without them the project is pointless. We
            ask that users participate in the project as much as possible, in
            particular we encourage them to:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>improve documentation (by asking for clarifications on existing docs)</li>
                <li>participate on the email lists (users are often the best people to support new users)</li>
                <li>report bugs</li>
                <li>identify requirements</li>
                <li>evangelise about the project</li>
                <li>anything else useful to the project as a whole</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <title>Contributors</title>

            <p>Contributors are community members who are relatively new to Simal.
            They make valuable contributions to the project, as discussed above,
            but have not yet earned full commit access to project resources.
            Therefore, contributions to project resources are through email
            discussion and via patches attached to issues in our issue tracker.</p>
            
            <p>Anyone can become a contributor, all you need to do is one or more of
            the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>participate on the email lists</li>
            <li>provide documentation</li>
            <li>report bugs</li>
            <li>fix bugs</li>
            <li>identify requirements</li>
            <li>add features</li>
            <li>evangelise about the project</li>
            <li>anything else useful to the project as a whole</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <title>Committer</title>

            <p>Committers are community members who have shown that they are
            committed to the continued development of Simal. This can either be
            through constructive contribution to project requirements, design
            discussion, documentation, evangalism, coding or any other valuable contribution.
            Committers are given commit access to the project resources.</p>
            
            <p>Anyone can become a committer. Typically they will need to show they
            have an understanding for Simal, its objectives and its strategy and
            have provided valuable contributions to the project. Once the existing
            committers feel that an individual has earned committership they will
            call a vote to accept the new committer.</p>

          <title>Project Management Committee</title>
        
            <p>The Simal Project Management Committee (PMC) consists of those
            individuals identified as "Project owners" on the development site.
            The PMC has additional responsibilities to ensure the smooth running
            of the project (see above). Membership of the PMC is by invitation
            only and must receive consensus approval of the current PMC members.</p>

      <title>Decision-making</title>
    
        <p>Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion
        with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most
        experienced developer. All discussion takes place on the
        simal-contributors mailing list. In order to prompt a discussion about
        a new development idea, send an email to the simal-contributors list
        with an appropriate tag in the subject line. For example, if you are
        looking for general discussion, use [RT] for "Random Thought". If the
        discussion (or your own thinking) has reached the point of a
        substantive proposal, use [Proposal] in your subject line.</p>
        
        <p>Usually, gaining consensus within the community is easy since all
        community members have a common set of interests. You will find that
        most day-to-day operations do not require explicit voting. So long as
        no one explicitly opposes a proposal then it is
        recognised as having gained consensus.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes a proposal will attract little or no comment from the
        community. This is not an indication of a lack of interest or support.
        In fact, it is the exact opposite of this, it is an implicit support
        for the idea being expressed. This is the concept of "Lazy Consensus".
        Lazy Consensus means that if no-one speaks, then no-one objects.</p>
        
        <p>For lazy consensus to be effective it is necessary to allow at least
        72 hours before assuming that there are no objections to your plans.
        This is to ensure that everyone is given enough time to read, digest
        and respond to your email.</p>
        
        <p> Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus, a few must gain
        explicit approval in the form of a vote. If a formal vote on a proposal 
        is called (signalled simply by sending
        a email with [Vote] in the subject line), then the following procedure
        applies. All participants on the simal-contributors list may express
        an opinion and vote. Express your opinion thus:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>+1      "yes", "agree" - also willing to help bring about the proposed action</li>
        <li>+0      "yes", "agree" - not willing or able to help bring about the proposed action</li>
        <li>-0      "no", "disagree" - but will not oppose the action going forward</li>
        <li>-1      "no", "disagree" - opposes the action going forward and must
        propose an alternate action to address the issue (or a justification
        for not addressing the issue) </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When a [Vote] receives a "-1", it is the responsibility of the
        community to continue discussion until that vote is either rescinded
        or the proposal itself is altered in order to achieve consensus
        (possibly by withdrawing it altogether). Where consensus cannot be
        achieved, the Simal Project Management Committee will decide the
        forward course of action.</p>
        
        <p>Every member of the community, from an interested user, through to the
        most active developer has a vote. We encourage all members of the community
        to show their support or otherwise with a vote and, where necessary, continued
        discussion. However, only committers in the project (as defined above) have
        binding votes for the purposes of decision making. It is the responsibility of
        the committers to ensure all voices are heard in a vote, so whilst users do not
        have a binding vote, a well supported -1 from a non-committer should be 
        considerd.</p>
