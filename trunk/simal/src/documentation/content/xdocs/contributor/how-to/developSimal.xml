    <title>How to develop with Simal</title>

    <version>0.1</version>

    <abstract>This How-To describes how to set up your development envirnment
    for working with Simal. Since Simal uses many Eclipse plugins in components
    of the Simal project it makes most sense for you to work within the Eclipse
    environment (although this is not a requirement, it just makes your life
    easier). This how-to therefore focuses on configuring Eclipse for working
    on Simal.</abstract>

      <section>
        <title>Subclipse</title>
          <p>We use a Subversion repository for our source code, therefore you need
          the subclipse plugins for working with the repository. Follow these simple 
          steps:</p>
          
          <p class="instruction">In the Eclipse menu select 
          <em>Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install...</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">In the resulting dialog select <em>Search for new
          features to install</em> then click <em>next</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">Click <em>New Remote Site...</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">Enter a <em>Name</em> of Subclipse and
          and <em>URL</em> of http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x and click <em>Finish</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">After a short delay whilst the update site is searched you will
          be able to expand the <em>subclipse</em> node and select <em>subclipse</em> for download.</p>
          <p class="instruction">[OPTIONAL] You may also choose to install the Mylar Integration
          plugin at this time. Mylar is not required, but is one of the optional plugins we
          will discuss later in this document.</p>
          <p class="instruction">Click <em>Next</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">Agree to the license terms (assuming you do agree that is)
          and click <em>Next</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">Review the plugins you have selected and click <em>Finish</em></p>
          <p class="instruction">After the plugins are downloaded click the <em>Install All</em> 
          button</p>
          <p class="instruction">Restart Eclipse when asked to do so</p>

    <section>
      <title>Get Simal Sources</title>
      <p>The first thing you need to do is checkout the Simal source code. To do this
      use the <a href="/resources/simal.psf">simal.psf</a> team set.</p>
      
      <p class="instruction">Save the <a href="/resources/simal.psf">simal.psf</a>
      file in a convenient location</p>
       
      <p class="instruction">In Eclipse select <em>File -> Import</em></p>
      
      <p class="instruction">In the dialog select <em>Team -> Team Project Set</em>
      and click <em>Next</em></p>
      
      <p class="instruction">Select the <em>simal.psf</em> file you saved earlier and
      click <em>Finish</em></p>
      
      <p>After following these steps the source code for Simal will be checked out from
      version control, ready for you to start work.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Get Rich Ajax Platform Sources</title>
      <p>At the time of writing we are using the CVS head version of the Eclipse
      Rich Ajax Platform. It is expected that, in the future, we will use a stable
      release of this code, but at present we need some features only available in
      CVS head. Follow the instructions on the 
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/cvs.php">Eclipse RAP</a> site.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Test Setup So Far</title>
      
      <fixme author="rdg">The simal configuration described in this section
      is not brought across as part of the import, neither is the model.test
      plugin.</fixme>
    
      <p>During development we use an embedded Apache Derby database. This
      enables you to do development work independently of any production
      database. The first thing you need to do is start the databse server.
      to do this right click on the <em>uk.ac.osswatch.simal.model.test</em>
      project and select <em>Apache Derby -> Start Network Server</em>.</p>
        
      <p>Now you should now be able to run the Simal web application. Open the <em>Run</em>
      wizard by selecting <em>Run --> Run</em> from the Eclipse menu. In the wizard 
      choose <em>Equinox OSGi Framework -> Simal RAP (Test Database)</em> and after that click <em>run</em>.
      Some messages in the console view should indicate that the http service was started 
      at port 100080. Now open a browser and type navigate to 
      <em>http://localhost:100080/rap</em> to access the Simal application.</p>

        <question>What is the difference between a How-To and a
        tutorial?</question>

        <answer>
          <p>The goal of a How-To is to help the reader to accomplish a specific
          task with clear and consise instructions. While tutorials may contain
          How-To-like instructions and content, they also include additional
          background and conceptual content to help teach their readers higher
          order concepts along the way. How-Tos are concerned about filling an
          immediate, short-term need. Tutorials often provide long-term
          knowledge which can be applied across a range of needs.</p>
