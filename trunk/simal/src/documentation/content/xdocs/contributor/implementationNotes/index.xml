    <title>Simal - Contributor How-To's</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>This section of the site contains a number of documents that
    describe the inner workings of the Simal project. These are
    technical documents and are therefore intended for technical
    readers. The intention is to provide a starting point to new
    developers wanting to find their way around in the code.</p>
    
    <p>These notes are intended to capture the current and past
    state of our implementation. Together they will provide an insight
    into the current design and the decisions we made to get here.</p>
    
    <p>These are evolving documents that contain fairly rough notes
    made by developers during their hacking. Often they will refer to 
    mailing list archives where more information can be found. Detail is
    usually added by those who come later, that is, those trying to 
    understand their content in a bid to understand the current 
    implementation. So, if you find yourself reading a section with lots
    of information hidden away in mail archives it would be great to have 
    you summarise that information as part of your research work.</p>
    
    <p>This is a great way make an early contribution to Simal and to pave
    the way for those who come after you.</p>
