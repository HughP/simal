    <title>Simal - Editor Forms</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>Forms are generated for us by the Eclipse Rich Ajax Platform.
      Therefore, we do not directly create HTML in order to add a form
      field. Instead we need to edit the form definition in Java.</p>
      
      <p>All controls, including the forms for editing data, are found
      in the <code>uk.ac.osswatch.simal.controls</code> package. Forms
      for editing objects are called <code>[OBJECT-NAME]EditorViewPart</code>.
      So, in this case, we need to work with
      <code>uk.ac.osswatch.simal.controls.ProjectEditorViewPart</code>.</p> 
      
      <p>The method <code>public void createPartControl(final Composite parent)</code>
      is the method responsible for the creation of the form components. So
      this is where we add our field. There is a helper class that provides
      methods for constructing fields for us, we will use this helper class
      to make our form code simpler.</p>
