    <p>There are three sites in the Simal project:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="ext:simal/projectSite">Project site</a> - jumping off point for everyone</li>
      <li><a href="ext:simal/devSite">Contributor site - all the project management and development tools</a></li>
      <li><a href="ext:simal/demoSite">Demo site - a demo site running a development version of Simal</a></li>
    </ul>
    
<!-- 
Linked from there you will find the "Informational Website" which goes to:

http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk/

There is a small amount of dev focussed content on the google code site
wiki. But the user focussed stuff is on the second site.

The content is generated using Apache Forrest
(http://forrest.apache.org) and the source for it can be found in
trunk/simal/src/documentation/content/xdocs in SVN (check the "source"
tab on the google code site).

I'm not sure if you are comfortable editing XML and workin with a
publishing framework like Forrest or not. If not then ask how to do
specific stuff here and we will help.

BUT...

We are currently in a transition stage. Moving from the 0.1 prototype to
our first real release 0.2 As a result I'm afriad our docs are in a bit
of a state of flux and most of the developer stuff has not kept up with
the 0.2 development. Ask and you will find the answers.

To make things really confusing, what little documentation we have for
the new stuff is written using Maven and split across the three modules
that make up the 0.2 version of Simal. I'll not go into detail about
where these are since you say you are not a developer and therefore I
guess you are more interested in the user level docs, which are all as
described above.

Confused yet? I'm sure you are - when you have more specific questions
like "what the hell are you on about, all I want to know is how to do X
for goodness sake" I'd be happy to give more targetted answers ;-)

What structure should we be heading for with our documentation?

Forrest is a great tool for pulling content from multiple places and
presenting it in a uniform way. So we can afford to have the content
where it is most appropriate an easily editable.

Current thinking (subject to change if seen as not appropriate):

The http://simal.oss-watch.ac.uk site is where *all* documentation will
be published.

The Google code wiki will house the basic developer focussed stuff. Just
enough to get people started.

The developer focussed docs relating to specific modules in Simal will
be maintained within the modules themselves. Currently the three modules
that make up Simal are:

uk.ac.osswatch.simal.core - the back end systems (data model, data
services and repository engine)

uk.ac.osswatch.simal.rest - a REST api to Simal core

uk.ac.osswatch.simal.web - an Apache Wicket user interface to Simal core

The "simal" module in SVN (the Forrest content object) will contain the
source for user focussed content. This will typically include things
like use cases, registry configuration, FAQs etc. Here I'm included both
types of user, that is, the "end user" who just wants to know what to
click on to make something happen and the "technical user" who doesn't
want to get into the code, but does want to know how to install and
maintain a complete system.

Note that Apache Forrest is able to pull content from multiple locations
so there is no need to duplicate content across multiple locations. For
example, the "Getting Started" document is useful to both the technical
user and the developer. It is currently housed in the Google code wiki
so that it can appear on the dev site, but it also appears on the user
focussed site. Both versions come from the same source file, they are
just presented differently.

Now, if you weren't confused before, you will be now. But at least we
have gone some way to documenting this already - I'm off to add an issue
to the tracker to remind us to extract a document from this thread. Keep
the questions coming.
