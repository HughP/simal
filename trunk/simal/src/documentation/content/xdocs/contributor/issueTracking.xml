    <title>Issue Tracking</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      We use the <a href="ext:simal/issueTracker">issue tracker</a> on our Google Code developer site to help
      us track bugs and feature requests. It is also used to help
      prioritise work and to indicate that someone is working on a
      specific issue. This document provides an introduction to working
      with our issue tracker.
    </p>

      <title>
        Users are encouraged to submit issues and to "vote" for issues
      </title>

      <p>
        Adding something to the issue tracker is not an instruction for
        someone to do the work described, it is merely a record that
        some work, in the opinion of at least one person, needs to be
        done. We therefore encourage all users of the Simal applications
        to add bug reports and feature requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before submitting an issue please search the tracker to see if
        anyone has already submitted the item. If an existing issue is
        found please indicate your interest in seeing the issue resolved
        by "starring" it. This is done by clicking the star next to the
        issue number (when "starred" this star will be yellow).

      <title>Issue management and Road Maps</title>

      <p>
        It is up to the Simal community as a whole to ensure that issues
        important to them get addressed. The only way to be certain a
        task is addressed is to do it yourself or find someone willing
        to make the modifications in return for a fee. See the next
        section for a discussion about how to contribute patches related
        to an issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use a combination of the priority and milestone labels to
        provide an indication of when an issue will be addressed. The
        milestone label indicates which release the issue is currently
        scheduled for whilst the priority indicates how likely it is
        that it will actually make it into the release. That is, the
        lower the priority the more likely the issue is to slip to a
        subsequent release if time forces such an action.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this way the issue tracker is used to define the road map for
        future releases.
