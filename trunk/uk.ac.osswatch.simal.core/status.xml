          <title>What is Simal?</title>

          <p>Simal is a framework for building systems for use by organisations that need to inform
            the communities around a group of related projects. The project is very young at this
            time, as such we welcome input into the requirements and design of the initial prototype
            system.</p>
          <p>This release focuses integrating data from third parties with Simal and on
          providing data in machine readable formats for third parties.</p>

        people. Command line options can be used to filter the people
        returned.</p>
      </action>
      
      <action context="feature" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        <p>Added <code>--summary</code> to the command line. This option
        summarises any output from the command line. For example, when used
        with <code>getProjects</code> or <code>write</code> the output
        will be information such as the project title and its URI.</p>

      <action context="feature" dev="RDG" type="add" importance="high">
        <p>Added <code>--nameFilter</code> to the command line. This allows commands
        to use a name filter. For example, the <code>getProjects --nameFilter foo</code> command
        will only get projects with 'foo' in their name.</p>

          <title>What is Simal Core?</title>

          <p>Simal is the core repository and command line interface of the Simal
            framework which is used to build project registries. That is a place to
            register filter and search details about projects. The project is very young at this
            time, as such we welcome input into the requirements and design of the initial prototype
            system.</p>
